<h2>About this App</h2>
<p>
    This app is an exploration of the central limit theorem. Task 1 asks students to try and guess a parent distribution by sampling. The samples are limited to a maximum of 50 to emphasize the challenge of hypothesizing the shape of a distribution from a small data set. Task 2 removes this limitation so students can better hypothesize the distribution but should understand the practical difficulties of taking samples of the sizes necessary to uncover the parent distribution. Task 3 asks students to understand that by using a sample mean we can make inferences regardless of the population distribution as they follow a normal distribution centered at the true mean. Task 4 asks students to explore the relationship between the sampling distribution standard deviation and the population standard deviation.
