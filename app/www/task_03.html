<p>
   How can we work with a sample of data if we do not know the distribution from where it came? 
</p>

<p>
  Before adjusting the sliders, choose each disitribution and click graph sample. You will see the parent population from which the sample data is coming from. These are the same distributions from the previous activities. 
  
  Next, for distribution A, adjust the sample size to 10, keep the number of samples to 1, and click graph sample. You will see a single dot appear on the graph. This dot represents the mean of 10 random observations from this distribution. You will also see the true mean of the population and the sample mean presented below the graph samples button. Adjust the number of simulations and choose update graph. You will now see that number of means of size 10 plotted on the graph. As you increase the number of simulations you are building the sampling distribution of the mean for the chosen distribution (A-D).

<ol>
    <li> For each parent distribution, construct the sampling distribution of the mean using various sample sizes. What is similar? What is different? </li>
    <li> For each parent distribution, how does the mean of the parent distribution compare to the mean of the sampling distribution? Is this affected by the sample size?</li>
    <li> For each parent distribution, how does the standard deviation of the parent distribution compare to the standard deviation of the sampling distribution?  How does the sample size affect this?</li>        
    <li> Click the samples check box. This will turn off the samples. Turn on the sampling distribution by clicking the check box next to sampling distribution. This will turn on the sampling distribution that the central limit theory posits for each distribution and sample size. How would you describe the sampling distribution of the sample mean for each distribution? Adjsut the sample size for each distribution (Click update graph each time you switch distributions) and notice how it changes. In general, what distribution appears to model the sample mean from any population?
