<h3> Task 2: Confirm the distribution </h3>
<p>
    Use the law of large numbers to confirm or adjust your choice for the parent distributions of samples taken from distributions A,B,C and D. Were you correct? 
</p>


<ol>
  <li>What sample size did it take to be confident you have identified the shape of each distribution? </li>
  <li>Now that you know the parent distribution shape, identify the smallest sample size that you feel confident can be used to identify each distribution.
  </li>
  <li>Do the sample sizes necessary to identify a parent distribution vary for each distribution? Can you explain when a larger sample size is necessary?
  </li>
</ol>
