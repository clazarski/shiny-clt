<h3>Task 1: Guess the distribution</h3>

<p>
    There are four parent distributions that you can sample from, A,B,C, and D. By taking samples of different sizes, can you identify the shape of the distribution that they are coming from? Shapes may include symmetric, bell shaped, uniform, or skewed. Once you believe you have correctly identified the parent populations, move to task 2.
