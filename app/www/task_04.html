<p>
   What is the relationship between the population standard deviation and the sampling distribution standard deviation?
</p>

<p>
  The central limit theorem tells us that the sample mean will follow a normal distribution that is centered at the true mean of the population. The standard deviation however is not so straight-forward. 
  
  This graph will show the sampling distribution that the central limit theorem defines for a given sample size and population standard deviation. The standard deviation slider controls the green distribution. Adjust this slider until it matches the blue curve. Use different sample sizes and try to uncover how the standard deviation is calculated. Specifically, for a given population standard deviation and sample size, how can you calculate the sampling distribution standard deviation? (Hint: Try sample sizes that are perfect squares)
